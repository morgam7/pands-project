# Iris Dataset

This is the repository containing my project for the Programming and Scripting module of the [Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics given by ATU Galway-Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics). My lecturer was [Andrew Beatty](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware?tab=overview&from=2022-12-01&to=2022-12-31). The project is an anlysis of the famous [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris).

To create this repository, I installed Python using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), and I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a text editor and terminal.

## Background on the Iris Dataset

The Iris Dataset was created by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. It contains measurements of various features of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width and contains 150 samples of iris, with 50 samples from each of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

Fisher's work highlights how the dataset can be used to demonstrate various statistical techniques and so the Iris Dataset has become a classic in the field of statistical analysis, serving as a benchmark for testing classification algorithms.

The Iris dataset is perfect for beginners in data analytics because it's simple and has a clear real-world application. We can visualise the flowers and understand why it's useful to study them. With features like the sepal and petal measurements, it's great for practicing classification and clustering techniques. And along with these qualitative variables we get a quantitive one also - species.

## Python Libraries

<details><summary>Pandas</summary><br>
Pandas is a powerful data manipulation and analysis library, offering data structures like DataFrame for handling structured data effectively.</details><br>

<details><summary>Matplotlib</summary><br>
Matplotlib is a versatile plotting library that provides a MATLAB-like interface for creating a wide range of static, interactive, and animated visualizations.</details><br>

<details><summary>Seaborn</summary><br>
Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.</details><br>

<details><summary>NumPy</summary><br>
NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions.</details><br>

<details><summary>Warnings</summary><br>
The warnings module is used to handle warning messages, and warnings.filterwarnings('ignore') suppresses these warnings to improve the clarity of the output.</details><br>

## Project Plan

Handup: Sunday 12th May


Week 1:
Created pands-project repository with jupyter notebook.
Uploaded url to vle.

Week 2:
Licked to image of iris on wikicommons
Researched iris dataset and wrote two paragraphs on background. (Used chat gpt to get a draft version of text here. I did edit it.)
Downloaded iris dataset from link given in project description: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris
Downloaded this to my pands-project folder so data displayed as csv file in vs studio.
There were two different datasets - bezdekIris and the iris dataset - not sure what the differnce is here

Used method Ian showed us of importing the dataset into my jupyter notebook using pandas.
Tried this first with the dataset I had downloaded but it didn't work.
So tried to use a link instead as he did in the tutorial but could not find a link to raw data online - didn't look that hard.
Decided to use the code on the https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris wevsite to get the dataset down.
DOesn't loolk right. Need to go over this agian. Have to leave it for now.

Week 3:

I caught up with Ian's lectures and he has a lecture in Week 8 which shows exactly how to load the iris dataset. And answers the questions I had from last week. 

The reason there are two version of the data from UCI is that there were a couple of errors in the original dataset and 
these are corrected. 

But following Ian's instructions I instead fetched the raw dataset from Michael Waskon's github: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv. I used the method that I tried originally which uses pandas and it worked with the link to the raw data on github.

I did a quick inspection of the data following Ian's tutorial. I inspected the data types.
