# pands-project
# Repository for Pands Project

# Project Plan

Handup: Sunday 12th May


Week 1:
Created pands-project repository with jupyter notebook.
Uploaded url to vle.

Week 2:
Licked to image of iris on wikicommons
Researched iris dataset and wrote two paragraphs on background. (Used chat gpt to get a draft version of text here. I did edit it.)
Downloaded iris dataset from link given in project description: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris
Downloaded this to my pands-project folder so data displayed as csv file in vs studio.
There were two different datasets - bezdekIris and the iris dataset - not sure what the differnce is here

Used method Ian showed us of importing the dataset into my jupyter notebook using pandas.
Tried this first with the dataset I had downloaded but it didn't work.
So tried to use a link instead as he did in the tutorial but could not find a link to raw data online - didn't look that hard.
Decided to use the code on the https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris wevsite to get the dataset down.
DOesn't loolk right. Need to go over this agian. Have to leave it for now.

Week 3:

I caught up with Ian's lectures and he has a lecture in Week 8 which shows exactly how to load the iris dataset. And answers the questions I had from last week. 

The reason there are two version of the data from UCI is that there were a couple of errors in the original dataset and 
these are corrected. 

But following Ian's instructions I instead fetched the raw dataset from Michael Waskon's github: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv. I used the method that I tried originally which uses pandas and it worked with the link to the raw data on github.

I did a quick inspection of the data following Ian's tutorial. I inspected the data types.
