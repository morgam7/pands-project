This is the repository containing my project for the Programming and Scripting module of the [Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics given by ATU Galway-Mayo](https://www.gmit.ie/higher-diploma-in-science-in-computing-in-data-analytics). My lecturer was [Andrew Beatty](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware?tab=overview&from=2022-12-01&to=2022-12-31). The project is an anlysis of the famous [Iris dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris).

To create this repository, I installed Python using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download), and I used [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as a text editor and terminal.

## Background on the Iris Dataset

The Iris Dataset was created by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936. It contains measurements of various features of iris flowers, including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width and contains 150 samples of iris, with 50 samples from each of three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Fisher's work highlights how the dataset can be used to demonstrate various statistical techniques and so the Iris Dataset has become a classic in the field of statistical analysis, serving as a benchmark for testing classification algorithms.

The Iris dataset is perfect for beginners in data analytics because it's simple and has a clear real-world application. We can visualise the flowers and understand why it's useful to study them. With features like the sepal and petal measurements, it's great for practicing classification and clustering techniques. And along with these quantative variables we get a qualitative one too - species.

## Dataset

I downloaded the dataset from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris) as Andrew suggested, but this dataset did not come with headers. So I instead used the dataset from [Michael Waskon's github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/iris.csv). Initially I used the method where I read the data by linking to the url - Ian showed us how to do this, but I decided to download the dataset as if there were any issues with accessing github my code would not work.

## Summary and Pandas

For the summary.txt file I used the [sys.stdout](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.stdout) function to write the file. The tricky part of this was the layout of the text file. Becasue the layout would be created by the python program I had less control over where text was placed. I used print() to print empty lines between each element.

I then used pandas functions to summarise the data. The pandas functions were useful for filtering the data. I filtered the data by species and variable. I also used the [groupby()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html) function to get the mean of each variable for each species. 

I also used the [corr()](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) function to find the correlation between the variables of each species using Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient. I had an issue here where the function would not work becasue of the species column which contains categorical values. So I filtered the dataset to get one with only the numerical values. Then I found out that I could use the [numeric_only parameter](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76533178/corr-results-in-valueerror-could-not-convert-string-to-float) which was a neater way to do it.

## Histograms

First I made a histogram for each variable using pyplot. Then, becasue I was interested in looking at each species seperately, I made histograms using Seaborn's [histplot function](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.histplot.html#seaborn-histplot). This allowed me to use the [hue parameter](https://www.statology.org/seaborn-histogram-hue/) to seperate the species.

The tricky part here was understanding the difference between axes level and figure level plotting functions. When I wanted to plot the four seaborn histograms on the same figure I needed to create an empty figure so that I could control how many axes there were. But then I wasn't able to use the [displot function](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.displot.html) that I had used for the Penguin project I did for Ian's course. Displot is a figure level function, so it creates the figure as it creates the plot. So I had to use the histplot function instead. And use pyplot to create the figure.

Reading the plots:

The individual histograms didn't really tell me much. When they were seprated out into species I could see that there was a standard distribution across all the variables in each species, which would be expected. 

Looking at the Petal Length and Petal Width histogram there is a clear seperation between the Setosas and the two other species. So petal lenght and petal width could be used to classify the Setosas. You could safely say that if an iris has a petal length of less than 2.5cm and a petal width of less than .75cm then the flower is likely a setosa.

Another thing to take away from the petal histograms is how much narrower the distribution was with the Setosas. So they are more uniform in petal size.

## Scatterplots

I used [Seaborn's pairplot function](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html#seaborn-pairplot) here to make the scatterplots. It also made four KDE plots for each of the variables. The pairplot function is very straigtforward to use and doesn't require any filtering of data. The only tricky thing was figuring out how to place the legend as the default positioned the legend in an awkward way.

Reading the Plots:

Looking at the scatterplots it is clear that the species cluster in most of the variables, with there being a very clear demarcation with the Setosas. The petal variables are the most useful for classifcation as there was more of an overlap with the sepal variables. Also the scatterplots clearly show that that setosas are the smallest flowers except when it comes to sepal width. Across all other variables the Setosas are the smallest with the Versicolor being the next biggest with the Virginica being the largest.

So the scatterplots backed up the findings from the histograms.

# Best Fit Line:

I then wanted to look at a best fit line to see how correlation petal and sepal width and lenght were. And I wanted these to be on the same figure. I used Seaborn's lmplot function for this. However I ran into the same issue as I did earlier. lmplot would not accept the ax parameter becasue it creates a stateful plot. 

I wanted to put these best fit lines on the same figure but lmplot does not support the 'ax' parameter I used earlier. 
So this is another eg of stateful v stateless plots. 
So I did some research and found that regplot would work with the 'ax' parameter but not with the 'hue'! So it woul
So I used the filtered pandas 


One of the frustrating things that happened when I was making these plots was that after I figured out how to make the plots and they were working fine, I was tidying up the presentation I changed the file name of the image and it was too long. But I didn't know that was causing the file to not save. It was saving as a txt file. I spent literal hours trying to figure out what had happened that my plots were no longer saving. And that was all it was - the filename was too long!
